## Basic Layout

The basic layout and design of the site is to start from a mobile view (minimum width of 500 pixels)  
and move up to tablet (minimum width of 800 pixels) and then up to desktop (any width above 800 pixels).

## Landing Page Contribution Outline

Orange colored text boxes go to a title header.
Smaller headings or sections that need to call attention should be in blue.
General text boxes should be in green.
All colored boxes should be outlined in a 1 pixel solid black border.

Background is white.

Icons used are made by **[Eucalyp](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/eucalyp)** from [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com)
*Remember to add credit to the icons on the site or page that icons are placed*

At the 800 pixel break point only three of the five icons are showing: Laundry, Toilet, and Vacuum.

Titles and text are centered in their containers unless they are a title header.

Mobile App mockup designs were made by Ciara ("CC") Beitel from our IOS team.
