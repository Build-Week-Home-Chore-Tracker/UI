            <p class="himeme">Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. In life you need colors. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Those great big fluffy clouds. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul.</p>
